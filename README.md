# latexstuff
LaTeX templates for doing cool stuff in academic papers or homework.

In particular, these were helpful for:
- lolmath.sty and proofhw.tex: Any proof-based mathematics
- avm.sty (not mine!) and featurestruc.tex: Feature structure grammars
- syntaxproblem.tex: Phrase structure grammars and sentence trees
- otproblem.tex: Phonology optimality theory tableaux and Hasse diagrams
- autoaata.tex: Automata
